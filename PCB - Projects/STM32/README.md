STM32 Development Board â€“ Custom PCB

This repository contains the schematic and PCB layout for a custom STM32-based development board. The schematic design is based on a tutorial by [Phil's Lab] (see below), but the PCB layout is fully original and created from scratch using KiCad.

Overview

The project is based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (or compatible), ideal for embedded development. It includes all essential components required to get started with STM32 programming, debugging, and I/O testing.

Features

SWD Header for flashing and debugging,
3.3V Voltage Regulator,
Reset Button,
User Button,
Status LED,
Crystal Oscillator with load capacitors and
Breakout I/O headers

Schematic source: Created independently by following the circuit by Phil's Lab
PCB Layout: Fully original layout, designed from scratch including component placement, routing, and clearance optimization.

This project was developed as a personal learning exercise.
